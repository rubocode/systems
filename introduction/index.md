## Introduction

> Great designs come from great designers, not from great design processes.  
> **Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.**

Systems are about order. Some systems are natural, others are designed by humans.

The focus of systems is to organize and maintain order.  In natural systems, there is a natural balance.

When we try to bring order into chaos, we need to design for purpose and harmony.

Systems, ultimately, manage intent.
