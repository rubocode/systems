## Understanding Order
> You are the light of the world.  
> A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a
> lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it
> gives light to everyone in the house.  
> In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see
> your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.  
> **Matthew 5:14-16 NIV**
