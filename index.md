## Understanding Order

> You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
> Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand,
> and it gives light to all who are in the house.
> Let your light so shine before men,
> that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.  
> **Matthew 5:14-16 NKJV**
